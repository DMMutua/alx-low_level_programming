This folder contains several C scripts that each perform basic tasks when compiled. The scripts leverage the concept of pointers or arrays or both.


0-strcat.c concatenates two strings, adding a terminating null byte to the concatenated string

1-strncat.c concetantes two strings, but with no null termination for 'n' or more bytes

2-strncpy.c copies two strings, working exactly like the inbuilt 'strncpy'

3-strcmp.c compares two strings, working exactly like the inbuilt 'strcmp'.

4-rev_array.c reverses the contents of an array of integers.

5-string_toupper.c changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase letters

6-cap_string.c capitalizes all words of a string
