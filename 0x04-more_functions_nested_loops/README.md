# Solving Problems with C functions and Nested Loops

#### This Section demonstrates - with C scripts - on how different simple problems can be solved using nested loops and other Concepts

## Scripts 

### 0-isupper.c
A function that checks for uppercase characters, returning 1 on availability and 0 on non-availability.

### 1-isdigit.c
A function that checks for digits 0 - 9, returning 1 for availability and 0 for non-availability

### 2-mul.c
A function that multiplies two integers

### 3-print_numbers.c
A function that prints the numbers from 0 - 9 followed by a new line

### 4-print_most_numbers.c
A function that prints 0 - 9, skipping 2 and 4, using _putchar twice

### 5-more_numbers.c
A function that prints 10 times the numbers from o to 14 followed by a new line

### 6-print_line.c
Drawing a straight line in the terminal

### 7-print_diagonal.c
Drawing a diagonal line in the terminal

### 8-print_square.c
Drawing a square of '#' followed by a new line

### 9-fizz_buzz.c
The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.
The script performs the test, printing numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

### 10-print_triangle.c
A function that prints a triangle of '#' followed by a new line

### 100-prime_factor.c
a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

### 101-print_number.c
a function that prints an integer.
